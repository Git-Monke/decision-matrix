## Project Technologies
- For this project, we are using jotai for state management and shadcn ui for the component library

## Routing
- We are now using react router for this project. The sidebar and header should always persist, and when the route changes, only the main content area should change

## Matrix Calculations
- Inverted, in the context of a matrix, means that higher values are WORSE. For example, price would be a typical example of an inverted field. 5 for Price would be bad, and so should be displayed as red and contribute 0 to the final mean.
